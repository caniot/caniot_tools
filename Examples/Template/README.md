# Template example

This is the simplest buildable example.We encourage the users to use the example as a template for the new projects.

1. Use an  `caniotBox_init` function to initialize caniotBoxLib peripheral.
2. Use an  `serialOutput_configure` function to initialize console serial with the given baudrate(only in wifi mode for HW15).
3. write to console using `serialOutput_sendString` or `serialOutput_sendRaw` .

## Example folder contents

The project **Template** contains two source file in C language [main.c,actions_task.c](main/main.c,main/actions_task.c). The files are located in folder [main](main).

ESP-IDF projects are built using CMake. The project build configuration is contained in `CMakeLists.txt`
files that provide set of directives and instructions describing the project's source files and targets
(executable, library, or both). 

Below is short explanation of remaining files in the project folder.

```
├── build.txt                  commands to be used for building the software with idf.py
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── main
│   ├── CMakeLists.txt
│   └── main.c
└── README.md                  This is the file you are currently reading
```

## Hardware

This example runs on CANIOTBOX boards without any extra modifications required,

### IDF Tools installations:

> **Note**
> ESP-IDF (Espressif IoT Development Framework) is required to build caniotBox application. If this is your first time using the ESP-IDF,Please follow this Video for Quick Start and refer to [ESP-IDF(release/v4.4.8) Installation Step by Step](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v4.4.8/esp32/get-started/index.html#installation-step-by-step) to download it.

### Build and Flash

Follow this Video to Build the project using idf.py build and flash it to the board using caniot application

### Troubleshooting

After flashing the BIN image, the SW should run correctly, but if the SW keeps doing reset loops forever, this means that the SW is running in some exception. In this Case we should bring the SW to factory image. TODO that: connect IO44(RXD0) to Ground for 10 Seconds and the SW will start from factory image. alternatively set `factory_reset_request` to 1 from the sdcard File  `Config/factory_reset.json`.

Please check what is wrong in your new Image by doing debugging!!!, that helps you to identify and fix errors or bugs in your new code.

### Debugging

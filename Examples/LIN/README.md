# LIN communication example


This example demonstrates how to use an LIN bus  simulation with caniot tools. Example does the following steps:

1. Use an  `caniotBox_init` function to initialize caniotBoxLib peripheral.
2. Use an  `serialOutput_configure` function to initialize console serial with the given baudrate(only in wifi mode for HW15).
3. write to console using `serialOutput_sendString` or `serialOutput_sendRaw` .
4. call `linAppl_init` to start your LIN application. this application code demonstrate how to use ISO TP handler to send and receive UDS Diagnostic frames:

     * **Step 1**. create `Lin_appl_diagnose_Task` to handle some UDS diagnostic sessions ,
     * **Step 2**. attach two handler to be called when Frame ID's 0x01 and 0x02 has been finished from the master scheduler.

## Hardware

This example runs on CANIOTBOX boards without any extra modifications required,

1. connect  CaniotBox to a  USB Port with your computer.
2. connect  `12V+(Dsub1)` with external 12V power supply and `Ground(Dsub3)` with external Ground.
3. connect  `LIN Data(Dsub9)` with LIN bus connected to another slaves(example NXP S32K116-Q048 Evaluation Board).
4. the SD card needs to be inserted into the slot.
4. connect CaniotBox with caniot application as described here [USB connection](https://caniot-docu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started-caniot.html#usb-connection).

### IDF Tools installations:

> **Note**
> ESP-IDF (Espressif IoT Development Framework) is required to build caniotBox application. If this is your first time using the ESP-IDF,Please follow this Video for Quick Start and refer to [ESP-IDF(release/v4.4.6) Installation Step by Step](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v4.4.6/esp32/get-started/index.html#installation-step-by-step) to download it.
